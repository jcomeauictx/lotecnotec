<div class="sidebyside">For filling one large propane tank from another, you ideally want a short POL male to POL male hose, capable of high pressure. The one from Mr. Heater's 2-tank hookup kit fits the bill, with only a 30-inch, small-diameter hose so you don't lose a lot of fuel every time you use it. Note that it can take <em>hours</em> to get a nontrivial amount of liquid propane from the upper, inverted (so liquid, not gas, is flowing), to the lower, upright, tank. And make sure you purge the lower tank by turning the slotted screw on the side of the valve counterclockwise, and tighten it again after purging. The shiny brass T can be used for a paperweight, or taken to a scrap dealer for a few cents. I can't think of any use for it outside of the intended purpose of the kit.</div>

<div class="sidebyside">These little stoves are great for camping, and perfectly fine for outdoor use at home, for the minimalist. You can find similar ones cheaper, but the included adapter that lets it run off a 1-pound propane tank (which you can refill from a 5-gallon tank with the proper adapter) makes it worth getting this particular make and model. I've found these cheap stoves fail within a year by leaking from the O-rings inside the screw adjustment. You'll need some 6.5mm OD by 1mm to 1.5mm (preferred) thickness O-rings to replace them when that happens. Meanwhile I'd recommend getting two stoves so you always have one working while you're waiting for parts for the failed one.</div>

<div class="sidebyside">For refilling the "non-refillable" 1-pound propane tanks, you need one of these ACME to CGA600 adapters. You'll find lots of videos online for doing the job, but most of them have dubious advice; for example, I've never needed to freeze the 1-pound cylinders before filling. Just invert your 5-gallon cylinder with the adapter in it, like on a picnic table; screw in your empty 1-pound cylinder; and lift the 5-gallon cylinder just enough, with one hand, to open the valve with the other. In one minute or so, your 1-pound cylinder should be mostly full. Close the valve, remove it, purge it for a second by pushing a nail or a piece of wire in to open the internal Schrade-type valve, then fill one more time. If it goes over a pound, don't worry too much, I've never had one explode on me yet. If it still feels almost empty, something is wrong with the cylinder. I've had a few like that.</div>
