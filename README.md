# lotecnotec

`lotecnotec` is the name of my (John Comeau &lt;jc@unternet.net&gt;) entry
in the Kinetic Grand Championship race every year since 2010, and on Robert
Van de Walle's advice, I made it my brand. The website herein will be both
for sharing information on minimalist, earth-friendly, design and ways, and
for selling my own products and Amazon affiliate links to quality products
I have used and can recommend.
